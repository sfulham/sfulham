# :wave: Hi there!
## About Me
Hi! I'm sfulham. 

I'm an Australian High School student, hobbyist software developer, Linux Expertish, and aspiring Sysadmin/Network Engineer.

I've been programming since I was about 10ish (I don't remember exactly), originally learning so I could make Minecraft mods (if you look at my old repos, you can see how crap they turned out).

I've since learned various other languages and would one day like to start my own business developing software, games and do network engineering for other businesses. 

I still have a lot to learn before then but hopefully that will happen soon.

If you would like to contact me, whether it be about working together on a project, or helpful tips about what and how to learn languages, technologies and tools, go to the [contact me](#contact-me) section below.
